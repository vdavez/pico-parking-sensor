# Parking Sensor

I have a small garage. When I'm parking a large car, unless I pull far enough into the garage, I can't shut the garage door. 

Practically, there are two good solutions for this problem: put a 2x4 where the front wheels should stop, or hang a tennis ball to touch the windshield when you've pulled in far enough.

What's the fun in *that*? Instead, I have a Raspberry Pi Pico, a handful of WS2812 self-addressable LEDs, a fancy VL53L1CX time of flight sensor, and some free time on my hands. So, let's make a stop light.
